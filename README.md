# Pong

Welcome to Pong, a duplicate of the classic Pong game! This is the first release of my Love2D game, and it contains many of the key features you'd expect in a Pong game, such as an opponent AI and a player pad that you can control with the W, S keys or the arrow keys.

## Features

This release includes the following features:

* An opponent AI
* A player pad that you can control with the W, S keys or the arrow keys
* A properly functioning ball

However, this release doesn't include some crucial features, such as a user interface, one keyboard multiplayer, a hi score system, and art assets. These will be added in future releases.

## How to Play

To play Pong, follow these steps:

1. Go to the [Love2D](https://love2d.org/) website.
2. Download and install LÖVE on your computer.
3. Download the release `.zip` file attached to this repository.
4. Extract the contents of the `.zip` file to a folder on your computer.
5. Drag the extracted folder onto the LÖVE icon on your desktop.

Once the game has launched, use the W, S keys or the arrow keys to control your player pad and try to score points by hitting the ball past your opponent's pad.

## Future Plans

In the next release, I plan to add the following features:

* One keyboard multiplayer
* Game over screen
* Art assets

Stay tuned for updates!
